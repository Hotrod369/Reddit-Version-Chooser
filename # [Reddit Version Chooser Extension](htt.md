# [Reddit Version Chooser Extension](https://github.com/Hotrod369/Reddit-Version-Chooser)

## Description

The Reddit Version Chooser is a browser extension that allows you to consistently use a specific version of Reddit: the old version, the new version, or the latest "New New" version. This is particularly useful as Reddit transitions between different versions, ensuring a consistent browsing experience.

## Features

- Choose between `www.reddit.com`, `new.reddit.com`, or `old.reddit.com`.
- Automatically redirects Reddit pages to your chosen version.
- Handles special URLs like modmail and media links without redirecting them.
- Retry logic to handle intermittent loading issues.
- User notification for failed loading attempts.

I created This simple browser extension because I was sick of my browser forcing me to use the New New Reddit. I know this post is off-topic but wanted to share something useful with my friends here on r/TheDonaldTrump2024.
